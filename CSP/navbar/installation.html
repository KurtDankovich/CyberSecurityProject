        <h2>Hosting T-Pot to Google Cloud</h2>
        <h3>Create VM Instance</h3>
        <p>The first step in setting up T-Pot on the Google Cloud Platform is to create a virtual machine instance.
          This instance can have any desired name.  For example, I used "csp-tpot" as my instance name.  Google Cloud offers different
          regions and zones in which a virtual machine can be hosted.  The United States has 4 main regions that consist of US-Central, US-West, and US-East.  US-Central 
          fitted my needs.</p>
          <p>The next step is to choose what kind of machine configuration should be used.  I chose E2 as this is a general purpose VM that is offered in the 
          Google Compute Engine.  E2 was introduced to be optimized, cost effective, and flexible with workloads.  T-Pot requires the machine to 
          run Debian 11 with using 8GB RAM and 128GB storage.  The total price to run this configured VM is $61.72 a month.

        <h3>Update System</h3>
        <p>The next step is SSH into the VM.  There is a button next to the instance name to do so.  Change to root by using: <b>sudo su -</b></p>
        <p>Use command: <b>apt-get update && apt-get upgrade</b></p>
        <p>apt-get update is used to get the latest package list from Debian repositories while apt-get upgrade will download and install updates for all the outdated packages on the system.  
          The list of sources that will be fetched can be found in /etc/apt/sources.list.

        <h3>Download Git</h3>
        <p>Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 in order to have developers work together on a project from different machines.  Git is a tool that developers use to manage source code and 
          allows developers to see any changes that were made to the source code of a project.  Git also gives developers a source of backup as Git allows to push recent changes to source code straight to Github.  
          Github is a user-friendly interface that acts as a Git repository that is hosted in the cloud.

        </figure>
        <h3>Clone T-Pot Repository</h3>
        <p>The next step is to clone the T-Pot repository onto the VM.  Git clone command is used to get an existing repository from Github.  The command will go to the repository that is listed
          and will download all the files needed to install T-Pot correctly.</p>
        <p>Use <b>git clone https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce.git</b></p>

        </figure>
        <h3>Give T-Pot Username/Password</h3>
        <p> In order for T-Pot to work correctly, it needs the configuration file that holds the username and password.  The configuration file path is iso/installer/tpot.conf.dist.  I moved the file to the root's home directory in order to use it easily.</p>
        <p>Open the configuration file in a text editor such as nano and locate the line labeled myCONF_WEB_user= ‘webuser’ and myCONF_WEB_PW= ‘w3b$ecret’.  To create username and password for T-Pot replace “webuser” and “w3b$ecret” with desired login information.</p>
        <p>To move a copy of T-Pot's configuration file use: <b>cp iso/installer/tpot.conf.dist /root/tpot.conf</b></p>
        <p>To open configuration file in text editor use: <b>nano tpot.conf</b></p>
        <h3>T-Pot Initial Installation</h3>
        <p>The step above may take a few minutes to download all the neccessary files.  Once the download is complete, the next step is to locate the installation file. 
          The installation file is found in ~/tpotce directory.</p>
        <p>To change into directory use: <b>cd tpotce</b></p>
        <p>Once changed into directory, list the files in directory using: <b>ls</b></p>
        <p>To list all files in directory and permissions use: <b>ls -la</b></p>
        <p>Notice the file named <b>install.sh</b>, this is the installation file which needs to be ran in order to run T-Pot on the VM.</p>
        <p>In command line use: <b>./install.sh --conf=/root/tpot.conf</b></p>
        <p>Once complete, the command line will say "DONE. Restart computer." Restart the Virtual Machine and T-Pot will take over from there.</p>

        <h3>Access T-Pot Interface</h3>
        <p>To access the T-Pot interface, you will need the IP address of the VM that was created.  This could be found in the Google Cloud Console under VM instances.  Next to the virtual machine should have an external IP address which is needed.</p>
        <p>In a web browser, enter the IP address into the search bar followed by :64297.  The dashboard is held on port 64297 as the dashboard uses Kibana which uses port 64297 to show data.  Below is how it should be formatted, x will be value of IP address of VM.</p>
        <p>Usage: <b>https://xx.xx.xx.xx:64297</b></p>
        <p>A login pop up will show up which requires the username and password set during the installation phase of T-Pot.</p>
        <p>Once the correct login information is given, the T-Pot interface will appear.  To view data collected from the honeypots set, click on the Kabana tab.</p>
